## Executive
### Shaping and building have independent cycles
### Time constraint as appetite for both shaping and building
### Integrating one slice from UI to backend during shaping
### Making a bet for what to build and honoring it
### Choosing either base, precedent or unprecedented cycle length with cool-down
### Breaking a project into independent scopes on a hill
### Hammering a scope to separate must-haves from nice-to-haves
## Shaping
### When we shape the work, we need to do it at the right level of abstraction
#### Wireframes are too concrete
#### Words are too abstract
### Shaping is to sketch a rough concept, leaving many details out
#### It's handdrawn-rough
#### It's why5-solved
#### It's variable-scoped
#### It's time-constrainted
#### It's private
### Once we think we've shaped it enough to potentially bet on, we package it with a formal write-up called a pitch.

## Executive
### Shaping and building have independent cycles
### Time constraint as appetite for both shaping and building
### Integrating one slice from UI to backend during shaping
### Making a bet for what to build and honoring it
### Choosing either base, precedent or unprecedented cycle length with cool-down
### Breaking a project into independent scopes on a hill
### Hammering a scope to separate must-haves from nice-to-haves
## Shaping
### When we shape the work, we need to do it at the right level of abstraction
#### Wireframes are too concrete
#### Words are too abstract
### Shaping is to sketch a rough concept, leaving many details out
#### It's handdrawn-rough
#### It's why5-solved
#### It's variable-scoped
#### It's time-constrainted
#### It's private
### Once we think we've shaped it enough to potentially bet on, we package it with a formal write-up called a pitch.
### Handdrawing a rough idea
#### Places
#### Affordances
#### Connection
#### A place is a thing that you can navigate to, such as menu, dialog etc. Write a word above a line for place, or draw a box.
#### An affordance is a thing user can act on, like field or button. Write a word under the line to indicate they can be found at that place.
#### A connection shows how an affordance takes the user from place to place. Draw an arrow from an affordance to a place.
## Pitching
### The pitch summarises the problem, constraints, solution, rabbit holes, and limitations. The pitch goes to the betting table for consideration.
## Betting
### Before each cycle, we hold a betting table during cool-down where stakeholders decide what to do in the next cycle.
### Six-week cycle
#### Some companies use two-week cycles (aka "sprints"). We learned that two weeks is too short to get anything meaningful done.
#### Within the six-week cycle, you can breakdown the weeks to smaller periods that you can assign to each scope of the project.
### Cool-down
#### If we were to run six-week cycles back to back, there wouldn't be anytime to breathe and think about what's next. Therefore, after each six-week cycle, we schedule two weeks for cool-down.
### Base case
#### Our base case is to run six-week cycle with two-week cool-down. Unprecedented case is 12-week cycle with 4-week cool-down.
#### For a shorter project, use a precedent case of 3-week cycle with 1-week cool-down.
### What about bugs?
#### The vast majority of bugs can wait six weeks or longer, and many don't even need to be fixed. You can't ship anything new if you have to fix the whole world first.
## Building
### Assigning project
#### Since the team was given the project, not tasks, they need to come up with tasks themselves. Here we note an important difference between tasks we think we need to do and tasks we discover we need to do.
#### The way to really figure out what needs to be done is to start doing real work.
### Scoping
#### Scopes are bigger than tasks but much smaller than the overall project. The scopes reflect meaningful parts of the project that can be completed independently and in a short period of time - a few days or less.
#### There are almost always a couple of things that don't fit into a scope. We allow ourselves a "Chowder" list for loose tasks that don't fit anywhere.
#### New tasks constantly come up as you get deeper into a problem. Mark nice-to-haves with tilde (~) in front.
### Integrating on slice
#### The team could start with UI, but until it's wired to a backend, nothing does anything.
#### Same with the backend. A lot of tasks could be checked off, but without any UI what can you do with it?
#### What we want is to pick of one slice of the project to integrate. When it's done, anyone can click through the interaction and see if the feature does what it should.

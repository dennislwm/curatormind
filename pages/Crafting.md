## Executive
### Shaping and building have independent cycles
### Time constraint as appetite for both shaping and building
### Integrating one slice from UI to backend during shaping
### Making a bet for what to build and honoring it
### Choosing either base, precedent or unprecedented cycle length with cool-down
### Breaking a project into independent scopes on a hill
### Hammering a scope to separate must-haves from nice-to-haves
## Shaping
### When we shape the work, we need to do it at the right level of abstraction
#### Wireframes are too concrete
#### Words are too abstract
### Shaping is to sketch a rough concept, leaving many details out
#### It's handdrawn-rough
#### It's why5-solved
#### It's variable-scoped
#### It's time-constrainted
#### It's private
### Once we think we've shaped it enough to potentially bet on, we package it with a formal write-up called a pitch.
### Handdrawing a rough idea
#### Places
#### Affordances
#### Connection
#### A place is a thing that you can navigate to, such as menu, dialog etc. Write a word above a line for place, or draw a box.
#### An affordance is a thing user can act on, like field or button. Write a word under the line to indicate they can be found at that place.
#### A connection shows how an affordance takes the user from place to place. Draw an arrow from an affordance to a place.
## Pitching
### The pitch summarises the problem, constraints, solution, rabbit holes, and limitations. The pitch goes to the betting table for consideration.
## Betting
### Before each cycle, we hold a betting table during cool-down where stakeholders decide what to do in the next cycle.
### Six-week cycle
#### Some companies use two-week cycles (aka "sprints"). We learned that two weeks is too short to get anything meaningful done.
#### Within the six-week cycle, you can breakdown the weeks to smaller periods that you can assign to each scope of the project.
### Cool-down
#### If we were to run six-week cycles back to back, there wouldn't be anytime to breathe and think about what's next. Therefore, after each six-week cycle, we schedule two weeks for cool-down.

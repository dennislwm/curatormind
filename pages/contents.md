## How does this board work?
### When should I use a new note?
#### Discuss a topic in greater detail.
#### Discuss a sub-topic.
#### Pivot away to another topic.
### Knowledge management
#### Set links between notes; search alone is not enough
#### Don't use categories; use tags
#### Use your own voice to capture thoughts; your own voice commits
#### Create a backlink using [[Nov 23rd, 2020]] annotation
### Logsec
#### Create a new file by typing the name of file in the Search box, leaving out any brackets or extension. This creates a markdown file under _pages_ folder.
#### Daily journals are stored as markdown files under _journals_ folder.
#### Create a tag after a sentence or paragraph. #tag
####

## How does this board work?
### When should I use a new note?
#### Discuss a topic in greater detail.
#### Discuss a sub-topic.
#### Pivot away to another topic.
### Knowledge management
#### Set links between notes; search alone is not enough
#### Don't use categories; use tags
#### Use your own voice to capture thoughts; your own voice commits
#### Create a backlink using [[Nov 23rd, 2020]] annotation

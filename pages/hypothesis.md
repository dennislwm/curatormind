title: Hypothesis

## How does this board work?
### 1. Develop a hypothesis
#### An incorrect true (IT) is the most satisfying intangible reward for a hypothesor, because it uncovered a true that was incorrectly labeled as false.
### 2. Rank hypotheses
#### These are ranked hypotheses in decreasing satisfaction:
##### Incorrect true (IT)
##### Correct true (CT)
##### Correct false (CF)
##### Incorrect false (IF)
#### A minimum lovable product (MLP) consists of the first two hypotheses:
##### Non-existent lovable feature (IT)
##### Existent lovable feature (CT)
### 3. Don't significantly increase complexity
#### We need to ensure that complexity does not increase significantly in proportion to the reward.
##### Existent bloat (CF)
##### Non-existent bloat (IF)
## Non-existent lovable feature #it

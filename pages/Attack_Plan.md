title: Attack Plan
---

## How does this board work?
### 1. Develop an attack plan
#### An attack plan is outside your comfort zone. This pushes the limit of your boundaries.
#### A big hairy audacious goal (BHAG) has at least three zones that are outside your comfort zone.
#### A dual-zone or risk has at least two zones that are outside your comfort zone.
#### A single-zone or risk has one uncomfortable zone.
### 2. Rank the attack plan
#### These are the ranked zones in decreasing importance:
##### BHAG-High (94)
##### Dual-High (90)
#####

title: Attack Plan
---

## How does this board work?
### 1. Develop an attack plan
#### An attack plan is outside your comfort zone. This pushes the limit of your boundaries.
#### A big hairy audacious goal (BHAG) has at least three zones that are outside your comfort zone.
#### A dual-zone or risk has at least two zones that are outside your comfort zone.
#### A single-zone or risk has one uncomfortable zone.
### 2. Rank the attack plan
#### These are the ranked zones in decreasing importance:
##### BHAG-BiasHigh (94)
##### Dual-BiasHigh (90)
##### BHAG-BiasLow (78)
##### Dual-BiasLow (76)
##### BHAG- (54)
##### Dual-Weekly (53)
##### Single-Yearly (53)
##### Single-Quarterly (44)
##### Single-Weekly (30)

title: Attack Plan
---

## How does this board work?
### 1. Develop an attack plan
#### An attack plan is outside your comfort zone. This pushes the limit of your boundaries.
#### A big hairy audacious goal (BHAG) has at least three zones that are outside your comfort zone.
#### A dual-zone or risk has at least two zones that are outside your comfort zone.
#### A single-zone or risk has one uncomfortable zone.
### 2. Rank the attack plan
#### These are the ranked zones in decreasing importance:
##### BHAG-Bias-High (94)
##### Dual-Bias-High (90)
##### BHAG-Bias-Medium (78)
##### Dual-Bias-Medium (76)
##### BHAG-Bias-Low (54)
##### Dual-Bias-Low (53)
##### Single-Bias-High (53)
##### Single-Bias-Medium (44)
##### Single-Bias-Low (30)
#### Based on the above ranking, it is a priority to attack a high bias, preferably with at least two zones that are outside your comfort zone.
### 3. Identify comfort zone
#### Growth or Status Risk
#### Idea-Extract or Safari Risk
#### Deploy or Scratch-Itch Risk
#### Policy or Decision Risk
#### Immersive or Behind-Curve Risk
#### Profit or Loss Risk
#### Market or Finance Risk

### Theme
#### (3rd) cupper-hugo-theme, both dark and light modes, too simple, images are centred, not sure if emojis are supported
#### (2nd) hugo-clarity - rich content, kids like it, emojis, unsure if images are centered, too wide for newsletter
#### (1st) hugo-theme-zzo - both dark and light modes, kids like it, emojis, unsure if images are centered, narrow width suitable for newsletter
#### hugo-xmag - the only magazine styled theme, looks old fashioned
### Marketing
#### Tweet and tag maker
#### Post to HackerNews, Indiehacker, Instagram, Reddit

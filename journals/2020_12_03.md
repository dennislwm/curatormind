## There are basically two components to the web, (1) renders in a web browser, (2) "as-a-service".
### [dennislwm/dscode: Docker starter project for Digital Ocean droplet](https://github.com/dennislwm/dscode) is an example of the former, as each module consists of a Docker container that renders in a web browser.
### [samber/invoice-as-a-service: ðŸ’° Simple invoicing service (REST API): from JSON to PDF](https://github.com/samber/invoice-as-a-service) is an example of the latter, as it does not require a browser to render the image.
## The best "renderer" for "as-a-service" is [Postman | The Collaboration Platform for API Development](https://www.postman.com). #it
## Alternatively, a pseudo "renderer" for "as-a-service" is creating a CLI using Python and Click. #if
### Fortunately, you can generate a skeleton code using both [patdaburu/generator-daburupy-click: A yeoman template for generating python command-line projects with Click.](https://github.com/patdaburu/generator-daburupy-click) and [yeoman/yo: CLI tool for running Yeoman generators](https://github.com/yeoman/yo), which are installed using npm.
## Using invoice-as-a-service as an inspiration, we could create chart-as-a-service. #it
### The idea is to convert JSON to PNG (REST API).
### For example, if I wanted to create an SPY chart with a sma(700) on high and sma(700) on low prices:
### { "symbol": "SPY, "sma": { "price": "high", "period": "700" }, "sma": { "price": "low", "period": "700"} }
### Using an article as a reference, we could build and deploy just the backend API server:

### The best answer is "The REST API is mainly used on the frontend when you need to load/change content dynamically without reloading the page."

## There are basically two components to the web, (1) renders in a web browser, (2) "as-a-service".
### The [dennislwm/dscode: Docker starter project for Digital Ocean droplet](https://github.com/dennislwm/dscode) is an example of the former, as each module consists of a Docker container that renders in a web browser.

## There are basically two components to the web, (1) renders in a web browser, (2) "as-a-service".
### [dennislwm/dscode: Docker starter project for Digital Ocean droplet](https://github.com/dennislwm/dscode) is an example of the former, as each module consists of a Docker container that renders in a web browser.
### [samber/invoice-as-a-service: ðŸ’° Simple invoicing service (REST API): from JSON to PDF](https://github.com/samber/invoice-as-a-service) is an example of the latter, as it does not require a browser to render the image.
## The best "renderer" for "as-a-service" is [Postman | The Collaboration Platform for API Development](https://www.postman.com).
## Alternatively, a pseudo "renderer" for "as-a-service" is creating a CLI using Python and Click.

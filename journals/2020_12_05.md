## I've been using Postman for months, but I just discovered it had a twin sibling Swagger, where you can write an API specification in yaml file and it will auto-create your docs, client and server code in python (or any language you want). #ct
### Swagger does not support FastApi, however there is a GitHub repo [digitalliving/openapi-to-fastapi: OpenAPI 3.0 to FastAPI route generator](https://github.com/digitalliving/openapi-to-fastapi) that does.
### For my first Open api project, I wanted to create a chart-as-a-service, namely FastChart API, that returns a stock chart as a PNG file.
### As an analogy, the FastChart CLI would have the following usage:
#### $ python fastchart.py --help
#### Usage: fastchart.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  This script returns a stock chart as a PNG file. 

Options:
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  sub    Sub indicator
SYMBOLS is one or more...
### This is a first draft of FastChart OpenAPI [FastChart | 1.0.0 | fxgit | SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/fxgit/FastChart/1.0.0)
#### There are two distinct paths: (1) /symbol/{id} and (2) /symbol/{id}/sub/{sub}
#### Both paths have an optional query to add a technical indicator to the main chart, e.g. SMA
#### Only the second path has offers a sub indicator that will be appended below the main chart, e.g. RSI
#### Both paths have an optional query to return a relative date or start and end dates

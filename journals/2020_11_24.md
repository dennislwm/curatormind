## Unfortunately, my intention to create a [newsletter-action](https://github.com/KNawm/newsletter-action) has been put on hold. Hypowork Digest will continue but on a less restrictive autoresponder.
## Previously, I had downloaded _The New Jerusalem Bible NJB.pdf_, which contains the full text of the Holy Bible. Follow that, I converted the pdf to text, which will require minor cleaning.
## The objective is to create an API to get bible quotes. There will be two layers, the API gateway, and the backend data. For the API, you can get bible quotes using book, chapter and verse. You can search bible using keywords, however couchdb doesn't support search. We will have to explore alternatives such as Elasticsearch. #if
SendGrid seems to have a strict criteria for new accounts; my application was rejected because "your business is not a good fit for our platform". #cf

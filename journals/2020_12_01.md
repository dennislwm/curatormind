## [pyaction](https://github.com/dennislwm/pyaction) failed due to release of a new version 0.7.0 of [ta library](https://pypi.org/project/ta). Fixed by reverting ta==0.6.1.
## Also, took this opportunity to add a new feature, refactor and test the code. Send E-Mail using Gmail (if yaml or env exists)
  Alert via E-Mail (if subject exists)
  Adjust DbsMa period higher to 12 (from 7), which means later shift

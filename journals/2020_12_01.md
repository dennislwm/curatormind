## [pyaction](https://github.com/dennislwm/pyaction) failed due to release of a new version 0.7.0 of [ta library](https://pypi.org/project/ta). Fixed by reverting ta==0.6.1.
## Also, took this opportunity to add some features, refactor and test the code. #ct
### Send E-Mail using Gmail (if yaml or env exists)
### Alert via E-Mail (if subject exists)
## We could optimize the parameters of Dbs indicator, i.e. DbsMa period. #it

## The Dbs Ma indicator chart for SPY has a bias error, which results in false positives. #be
### If you take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/gallery/eINfP3z), the last bearish period between Oct and Nov 2020, the low did not cross the previous low of the neutral period.
### Ideally, we would want that bearish period to be neutral. Hence we need to reduce the **bias** error, which can be achieved by adding an indicator. This new indicator should be used to confirm when Dbs Ma shifts to a bullish or bearish.
### Note that optimizing the Dbs Ma parameter will not reduce the **bias** error, but instead increase or decrease the lag of the indicator.

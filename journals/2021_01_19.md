## Hypothesis: Imposter syndrome stifles individual creativity and reduces growth on the Internet
### Analogy: Shopping malls throughout Singapore have very similar shops, usually big chains or franchises. Usually, the concept shops don't survive long enough in shopping malls because of the high rent, and they are found in low traffic areas, such as HDB, etc.
### Mission: To bring individual creativity to the mainstream
### Vision: To allow individual creativity to thrive even in low

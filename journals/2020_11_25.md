- Postman is really useful, again I've documented a collection of API requests. This time it is for [Biblia](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8994004/TVmFizQo).
- Here I rank and categorize all Biblia requests:
	- Existent lovable feature #ct
		- Bible Content
		- Bible Search
		- Table of Contents
	- Existent bloat #cf
		- Bible Scan
		- Bible Parse
		- Bible Tag
		- Bible Compare
		- Bible Find
		- Bible Image
	- In addition, there are some features missing, which I plan to add:
		- Non-existent lovable feature #it
			- The Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE)
			- Bible Verse of the Day
		- Non-existent bloat
	- Biblia offers a [free Verse of the Day plugin](https://biblia.com/plugins/VerseOfTheDay) from its website Biblia.com, however the [available bibles](https://bibliaapi.com/docs/Available_Bibles) does not include The Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE). Hence, we will have to [web scrape](https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/john/2/19-20) as a workaround. #it

## Career / online profile
### I have created a new [[Attack Plan]] because looking for a job is full time activity.
### This plan has a high bias because I haven't looked for a job in a long time, and also my skillset may not be easily fit into the market.
### There are three uncomfortable zones that this plan addresses:
#### 1. Income risk by seeking a compensation of at least $5k per month
#### 2. Behind-curve risk by updating my knowledge of technicals
#### 3.

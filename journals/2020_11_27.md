## [Skillpub](https://github.com/skillpub/collaboration) is a python chatbot package that automates connectors to your python scripts from chat apps.
### Python scripts in folder _skills_ can be run from chat apps, i.e. file name is command to run.
### First line in file in triple quotes is skill description, text your bot **skills** or **help** to see it.
### The shortest python script requires only two lines, one for the description, and one to run a code, e.g. print().
## Myth: Landing page before building a product

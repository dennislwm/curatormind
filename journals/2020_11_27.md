## [Skillpub](https://github.com/skillpub/collaboration) is a python chatbot package that automates connectors to your python scripts from chat apps. #it
### Python scripts in folder _skills_ can be run from chat apps, i.e. file name is command to run.
### First line in file in triple quotes is skill description, text your bot **skills** or **help** to see it.
### The shortest python script requires only two lines, one for the description, and one to run a code, e.g. print().
## My GitHub repo [pydocker-cli] consists of tiny apps that are executed as python commands. Skillpub could be incredibly useful, if it works, as I could expose these tiny apps from any chat apps, such as Telegram. #it

### Write one or two blog posts every month that are related to some of the tech stack.
### Keep a separate mailing list for signups that are unrelated, such as blog posts, etc.

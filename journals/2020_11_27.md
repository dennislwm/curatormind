## [Skillpub](https://github.com/skillpub/collaboration) is a python chatbot package that automates connectors to your python scripts from chat apps.
### Python scripts in folder _skills_ can be run from chat apps, i.e. file name is command to run.
### First line in file in triple quotes is skill description, text your bot **skills** or **help** to see it.
### The shortest python script requires only two lines, one for the description, and one to run a code, e.g. print().
## Myth: Landing page before building a product #if
### This works only if you build a product that has a similar tech stack to your previous products.
### Open up a mailing list and share some progress updates.
### Write one or two blog posts every month that are related to some of the tech stack.
### Keep a separate mailing list for signups that are unrelated, such as blog posts, etc.
### Use Twitter to share process and progress updates.

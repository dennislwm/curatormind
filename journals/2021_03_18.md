## Research a no-code QR code solution for COTT #nocodeops
### robust - work flow must out last programmer
### cost - cheap and scale up linearly
### nocode - easy to manage by both programmer and admin
## The proposed workflow is to use Telegram and a Bot
### Bot has predefined commands such as /help, /start, /qrcode, /mass etc
### Pipedream was initially proposed to allow admin to create a dialog flow, however it doesn't support conditional steps.
### Google sheets was then proposed to allow admin to
## Pipedream has many pros but a few cons: #nocodeops
### cost - generous free tier of 100k invocations and it scales up by $10 per additional 100k invocations (1 trigger = 1 invocation)
### robust - integrates with many SaaS, such as Todoist, Airtable, Google Sheets, Telegram, however it doesn't support conditional steps ([#587](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/discussions/587))
### nocode - you can code and publish an npm package, and then code a step to consume your package, however this requires coding

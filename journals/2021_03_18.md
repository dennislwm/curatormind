## Research a no-code QR code solution for COTT #nocodeops
### robust - work flow must out last programmer
### cost - cheap and scale up linearly
### efficient - performance scale up with number of users
## Pipedream has many pros but a few cons: #nocodeops
### cost - generous free tier of 100k invocations and it scales up by $10 per additional 100k invocations (1 trigger = 1 invocation)
### robust - integrates with many SaaS, such as Todoist, Airtable, Google Sheets, Telegram, however it doesn't have conditional steps as yet ([#587](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/discussions/587))
